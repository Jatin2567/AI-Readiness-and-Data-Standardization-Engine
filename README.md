# AI-Readiness-and-Data-Standardization-Engine
This project implements a domain-agnostic, pre-AI data readiness pipeline for public datasets.   It helps assess whether tabular datasets (CSV/XLSX) are suitable for AI and advanced analytics, standardizes them safely, and produces explicit outputs before datasets are used in AI workflows.
